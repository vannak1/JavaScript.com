            Found an interesting piece of JavaScript news you’d like to share
            with the community? Great! Here are the next steps.

          h2 Submitting a Story
          p.
            To add a story, simply click the “New Post” button on the
            #[a(href='/news') News page].
            You’ll need to authenticate with GitHub before you can add a post
            (if you don’t have a GitHub profile yet, you can
            #[a(href='https://github.com/join') create one]
            on their site). You can then create a story, including the title,
            link, and brief description. Every post is moderated before it’s
            published, so once you hit “Submit,” your story goes into the queue
            for approval.

          p.
            Here are a few do’s and don’ts to make sure your story gets shared
            with the community.

          h3 Do:
          ul.list.list--styled.mbm
            li.list-item.
              Keep it informative and brief, but not too brief — posts need to
              be between 100–300 characters
            li.list-item.
              Make sure what you’re posting has good educational value
            li.list-item.
              Contribute — this community is only as good as its communication,
              so speak up!

          h3 Don’t:
          ul.list.list--styled
            li.list-item.
              Add job postings, blog advertisements, or any other promotional posts
            li.list-item.
              Rant — let’s keep things civil and open
            li.list-item.
              Be shy — feel free to engage in conversation and add stories regularly
