            #[strong JavaScript.com]
            is a resource built by the
            #[a(href=links.codeschool) Code School]
            team for the JavaScript community.
            It is now and will always be free.

          p.
            Because JavaScript is a great language for coding beginners,
            we've gathered some of the best
            #[a(href='/resources') learning resources]
            around and built a
            #[a(href='/try') JavaScript course]
            to help new developers get up and running.

          p.
            With the help of community members contributing content to the
            site, JavaScript.com aims to also keep more advanced developers up
            to date on news, frameworks, and libraries.
